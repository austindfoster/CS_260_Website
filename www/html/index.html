		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>Hi, my name is Austin Foster. I am a <strong>computer science student</strong> with an <em>emphasis</em> in <strong>software engineering</strong>. I have experience building 2 android apps from scratch and in-depth testing structures. Most of my experience comes from courses I have taken at BYU from the past 4 years. I would like to work as an app developer and software designer. I feel that I have many artistic skills that other programmers and developers lack to make their projects appealing. A secondary career goal is to work on a video game at some point. I have several 3D Software talents and I enjoy spending the free-time I do have on creating models and art pieces, or playing video games. Click the links to see more of my work. I hope there is something from my skillset that can be useful to anyone interested.
